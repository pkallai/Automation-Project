TD could capitalize on this by boosting its digital account openings for both TD Bank US and TD Canada by leveraging Plaid to aggregate financial data from competitors and offer seamless, real-time onboarding.
2. Cross-Selling Financial Products
Plaid’s data aggregation gives TD a complete view of a customer’s financial landscape, including assets, debts, and spending patterns across multiple institutions. This holistic view allows TD to offer targeted, personalized financial products like loans, mortgages, or investment opportunities.

Expected Impact:
A study by PwC showed that banks using open banking tools to offer personalized products have seen a 25% increase in cross-selling rates.
For TD, this could translate to a significant uptick in credit card signups, personal loans, and investment products, especially in the US market, where customer segmentation based on spending behavior is highly effective.
3. Reducing Digital Attrition
With Plaid’s real-time aggregation, TD can offer a more holistic personal finance management tool, keeping customers within its ecosystem. Customers using TD’s digital platform can see all their financial accounts (including non-TD accounts), reducing the need to use multiple apps and improving engagement.

Expected Impact:
A Tink survey from the UK suggests that account aggregation services reduce digital churn by up to 15%, as customers prefer the convenience of having all their financial data in one place.

In both Canada and the US, TD can leverage Plaid to offer personalized financial services to the underbanked and unbanked populations. By aggregating data from alternative financial institutions (e.g., fintechs or credit unions), TD can better assess risk and extend loans or credit to customers who may lack traditional banking history.

Expected Impact:
According to Plaid, using open banking data to assess alternative financial histories can increase loan approval rates by up to 20% among previously underserved customer segments.
This could be particularly valuable in the US, where 27% of Americans are considered underbanked or unbanked (FDIC).
5. Data-Driven Innovation
Through real-time access to customers’ aggregated financial data, TD can drive innovation by developing hyper-personalized digital products. For example, TD could introduce new savings tools or dynamic investment products tailored to an individual’s spending and saving habits, creating new revenue streams.

Expected Impact:
Banks that have integrated data-driven personalization into their product development, like BBVA and Barclays, have reported an 18-20% increase in customer satisfaction and a 10% increase in digital product engagement.
